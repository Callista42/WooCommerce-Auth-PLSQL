# WooCommerce Authentication with PL/SQL
A function to construct the URL request to communicate with the WooCommerce API through PL/SQL.

I struggled to find a good example of OAuth 1.0 authentication over HTTP protocol using PL/SQL so with a little help and API documentation, I have created my own.

Thanks to SomeCodingHero for sharing his experiences in the below link which helped me construct my function.
